## Style & Philosophy

### Carpet

Gnembon [envisioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt-ooRGpLz4) his Carpet mod to
give more control to the game,
facilitate understanding of various mechanics,
address bugs/inefficiencies,
and provide alternatives to missing/lacking issues.
All while preserving the vanilla feel and making minimal/non-destructive changes.

This mod is thus made with this philosophy in mind,
and anything that requires more drastic changes to the game will be separated into different mods instead.

### Renewability

### Naming Convention

There are a lot of good ideas when it comes to alternative designs/options
such as how sand should be renewed (drops from husks, anvil crushing cobblestone, eroding from corals, etc.).
Thus we should name the settings specific enough that it shouldn't result in a naming conflict despite the mod namespace.

E.g. prefer [`huskDropsSand`](https://github.com/MultiCoreNetwork/carpet-redcraft-addons?tab=readme-ov-file#huskDropsSand) and [`anvilCrushStone`](https://gitlab.com/Ma_124/mc-anvil-crush/#anvilcrushstone) to the more generic [`renewableSand`](https://github.com/gnembon/carpet-extra?tab=readme-ov-file#renewablesand).

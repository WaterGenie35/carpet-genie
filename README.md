## Philosophy

### Carpet

Gnembon [envisioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt-ooRGpLz4) his Carpet mod to give more control to the game, facilitate understanding of various mechanics, address bugs/inefficiencies, and provide alternatives to missing/lacking issues. All while preserving the vanilla feel and making minimal/non-destructive changes.

This mod is thus made with this philosophy in mind, and anything that requires more drastic changes to the game will be separated into different mods instead.

### Renewability
